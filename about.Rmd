Hi, my name is Maya Vick. I am currently a sophomore at Appalachian State University and I'm studying statistics as an overall major. I am originally from Winston-Salem, where I have lived for a majority of my life with my parents and little brother. 

I have a couple interests, mostly listening to music and relaxing. I really like relaxing, honestly.
As long as weather permits, I'm most likely out lounging in the sun and reading Lord of the Rings, only Fellowship though since I haven't been reading as much as I wish I could :(
